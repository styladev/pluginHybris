# Styla Hybris Plugin

This plugin connects your Hybris Store with [Styla](http://www.styla.com/) magazine. The first diagram on [this page](https://styladocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CO/pages/9961481/Technical+Integration) should provide you an overview of what the plugin does and how it exchanges data with Styla. 

The plugin relies on hybrisâ€™ Service Layer Architecture and needs version 5.0 or higher.
